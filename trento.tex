\begin{abstract}
   We investigate entropy deposition at mid-rapidity in pp, pA and AA systems using a generalized mean of projectile and target 
densities $M_p(T_A,T_B)$ which describes a family of vector norms spanning a continuum of projectile/target saturation scenarios. 
Results are presented for three well known subcases of the generalized mean, the arithmetic, geometric and harmonic forms and 
compared against charged particle production in a wide range of collision systems. When combined with partonic density fluctuations of 
the nucleons within each nucleus, the data is well described by a generalized mean with power $p$ close to zero. We encapsulate 
these results in a new model for relativistic hydrodynamic initial conditions.

\section{Intoduction}

The discovery of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at RHIC initiated a large scale effort to quantify the transport properties of 
hot and dense nuclear matter. The success of ideal hydrodynamics in describing the collectivity observed in ultra-relativistic 
heavy-ion collisions supports the production of a fluid-like QGP with minimal specific shear viscosity close to the proposed 
K.S.S. bound $\eta/s \ge 1/4\pi$ \cite{constraining-ic}. 

Extractions of $\eta/s$ from experiment using viscous hydrodynamics describe the emergence of collective flow from spatial 
deformations of the produced fireball with a conversion efficiency proportional to the system's average specific shear viscosity [?]. 
Consequently, model-to-data predictions of $\eta/s$ are beholden to the veractity of theoretical models used to calculate entropy and 
energy deposition in the initial state.

\section{Motivation}

We characterize entropy deposition in nucleus-nucleus collisions in terms of an eikonal mapping defined over the transverse \emph{participant} density 
of projectile and target nucleons $T_A$ and $T_B$ separated by impact parameter ${\bf b}$,
\footnote{We choose entropy density as a convenience to make direct comparisons with charged particle distributions}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dS({\bf r}_\perp)}{d^2r_\perp dy} \biggr \rvert_{y=0}  = f(T_A({\bf r}_\perp + {\bf b}/2),\,T_B({\bf r}_\perp - {\bf b}/2)).
\end{equation}

It's reasonable to insist that $f$ respect several key properties, namely that $f$ is smooth, monatonic and symmetric in 
the variables $T_A$ and $T_B$ and that it saturates in the limit $T_A \ll T_B$ and $T_B \ll T_A$.

Motivated by these stipulations, we consider the family of vector p-norms known as the generalized mean as a suitable ansatz for the mapping $f$,
\begin{equation}
 \label{generalized mean ansatz}
 f(T_A, T_B) \propto M_p(T_A,T_B) 
\end{equation}
where the generalized mean is defined as,
\begin{equation}
 \label{generalized mean}
 M_p(T_A,T_B) = \left( \frac{T_A^p + T_B^p}{2} \right)^{1/p}.
\end{equation}

For $p = \{-\infty,-1,0,1,\infty\}$, the generalized mean becomes minimum, harmonic, geometric, arithmetic and maximum functions respectively. Increasing 
values of $p$ result in decreasing saturation so that these subcases of the generalized mean obey the following ordering inequality, 
\begin{equation}
 M_{-\infty} \le M_{-1} \le M_{0} \le M_{1} \le M_{\infty}.
\end{equation}
The dependence of the saturation on $p$ is best visualized by fixing the thickness of the projectile $T_A$ and varying the thickness of the target $T_B$ for 
different values of $p$ as shown in figure [1].

\end{figure}

It's illuminating to compare this ansatz against the commonly used wounded nucleon and binary collision parameterization where the transverse entropy (or energy) density 
is set proportional to a linear combination of the local density of participant and pair-wise collisions. For deterministic or black disk nucleon collisions 
(see reference [?]), this popular Glauber ansatz can be cast in the form \footnote{Technically the name Glauber is a misnomer, as both the generalized mean and 
two component model rely on an underlying Glauber description of participant nucleons, but the binary collision and wounded nucleon description has become synonymous
with the Glauber name}
(\ref{generalized mean ansatz}). 
\begin{equation}
 f(T_A,T_B) \propto (1-\alpha)\frac{T_A+T_B}{2} + \alpha \, \sigma^{inel}_{NN} T_A\, T_B. 
\end{equation}
Both the generalized mean and Glauber ansatz are equivalent to the arithmetic mean for $p=1$ and $\alpha=0$. That is however, where the simularities end. 

The generalized mean is a homogenous function of $T_A$ and $T_B$ while the Glauber model contains a binary collision term proportional to $T_A T_B$. This Glauber
binary collision term is typically tuned to fit the centrality dependence of the charged particle multiplicity as it rises non-linearly with centrality.

An interesting consequence of the non-homogeneity introduced by the existence of a binary collision term is manifest in central U-U collisions.


\section{The Model}
We sample nucleon coordinates in the projectile and target nuclei using the realistic nucleon configurations calculated by Alvioli 
and Strickland [?].

We follow the precription of [ref] and calculate pairwise collisions of nucleons in pp, pA and AA collisions from the proton-proton 
overlap function,
\begin{align}
 T_{pp}(b) &= \int dx~dy \,T_p(x-b/2,y) \,T_p(x+b/2,y),
\end{align}
where $b$ denotes the proton-proton impact parameter and $T_p(x,y)$ the proton's z-integrated parton density.

The probability for a pairwise collision is given by,
\begin{equation}
  P^{inel}_{NN}(b) = 1 - \exp \left(-\sigma_{gg} N_{gg}^2 T_{pp}(b) \right), \\[1ex]
\end{equation}
where the exponential factor $\sigma_{gg} N_{gg}^2$ is fixed to reproduce the inelastic proton-proton cross section,
\begin{equation}
  \sigma^{inel}_{NN} = \int 2 \pi b \,db \, P_{NN}^{inel}(b).
\end{equation}

The pair-wise collision probability is sampled independently for each pair of nucleons in the collision and target
