\section{Introduction}

Over the last decade, the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision programs at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have succeeded in producing and exploring a novel highly excited phase of QCD matter, dubbed the strongly interacting Quark-Gluon Plasma (sQGP) \cite{Arsene:2004fa,Adcox:2004mh,Back:2004je,Adams:2005dq,Gyulassy:2004zy,Muller:2006ee,Muller:2012zq}. Among the major goals of current research into the sQGP are the quantitative characterization of its properties, such as its transport coefficients and its equation of state as well as the exploration of the complex non-equilibrium dynamics that leads to its creation during the first fm/c of the nuclear collision. 

Generally, the determination of sQGP properties relies on their extraction from a comparison of computational models for the full time-evolution of the heavy-ion collision to data on the measurable final state properties of the collision \cite{}.
Viscous relativistic fluid dynamics provides a stable, well-tested model for this time-evolution and the collective
behavior in high-energy nuclear collisions \cite{}.  However, a realistic Monte Carlo (MC) model for the initial state
of the medium is essential for describing many event-by-event observables.  These initial conditions remain
one of the most poorly-constrained components of modern computational models \cite{}.

Initial condition models create profiles of energy or entropy at the time of sQGP formation which are then evolved by
fluid dynamics.  Perhaps the simplest prescription is the so-called wounded nucleon model, which determines
participating nucleons via optical overlap and deposits a blob of energy or entropy for each participant.  The
MC-Glauber model generalizes wounded nucleons by additionally depositing entropy proportional to the number of
binary nucleon-nucleon collisions.  Despite its simplicity, the Glauber model has qualitatively fit a large number 
of experimental measurements \cite{}.

The current state-of-the-art for initial condition models is the IP-Glasma model \cite{}, which is based on the color-glass condensate (CGC) effective field theory \cite{} to create a
dynamical description of the pre-fluid stage of the collision.  IP-Glasma has been able to quantitatively describe the latest event-by-event data on higher order flow harmonics as well as many other observables \cite{Schenke:2014zha}. It's main draw back is it's  computational
complexity and that it's applicability to smaller collision systems (e.g.~proton-proton) remains uncertain.

In this letter, we present a new initial condition model, \trento, for high-energy nuclear collisions across the full collision system range from proton-proton to uranium-uranium. In concert with transport calculations of the time-evolution of ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions our model is capable of constraining the initial state of the sQGP at the time of its formation. Note that it is not designed to model the dynamics of thermalization of QCD matter and sQGP formation. However, it's constrained initial state can provide guidance on the outcome that needs to be achieved by these calculations. 

\section{The Model}

\trento\ is constructed in a similar fashion as the two-component Glauber model, but uses a different ansatz
for entropy production.

Suppose a pair of projectiles labeled $A$, $B$ collide along beam axis $z$.  Each projectile is represented by
the beam-integrated density of its nuclear matter, typically called thickness:
\begin{equation}
  T_{A,B}(x, y) = \int dz \, \rho_{A,B}(x, y, z).
\end{equation}
The construction of the thickness functions will be addressed in the following subsections; first, we
postulate the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The eikonal approximation is valid:  entropy is produced if $T_A$ and $T_B$ eikonally overlap.
  \item There exists a scalar field $f(T_A, T_B)$ which converts projectile thicknesses into entropy
    deposition.
\end{enumerate}
The function $f$ is proportional to the entropy created at mid-rapidity and at the hydrodynamic thermalization
time:
\begin{equation}
  f \propto dS/dy \, |_{\tau = \tau_0}.
\end{equation}
It should provide an \emph{effective} description of early collision dynamics:  it need not arise from a
first-principles calculation, but it must obey basic physical constraints.

With this in mind, we introduce for $f$ the \emph{reduced thickness}
\begin{equation}
  f = T_R(p; T_A, T_B) \equiv \biggl( \frac{T_A^p + T_B^p}{2} \biggr)^{1/p},
  \label{eq:tr}
\end{equation}
so named because it takes two thicknesses $T_A$, $T_B$ and ``reduces'' them to a third thickness, similar to a
reduced mass.  The dimensionless parameter $p$ may take any real value in $(-\infty, \infty)$ and is to be
determined by experiment.  This functional form---known as the generalized mean---simplifies to the arithmetic,
geometric, and harmonic mean for certain values of $p$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  T_R(p; T_A, T_B) =
  \begin{cases}
    \dfrac{T_A + T_B}{2} & p = 1 \text{ (arithmetic)}, \\[2ex]
    \sqrt{T_A T_B} & p = 0 \text{ (geometric)}, \\[2ex]
    \dfrac{2 T_A T_B}{T_A + T_B} & p = -1 \text{ (harmonic)}. \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
More generally, $p$ quantifies the attenuation of entropy production in asymmetric ($T_A \neq T_B$) regions of
the collision, as demonstrated in FIG.~\ref{fig:saturation}.  As $p$ \emph{decreases}, the degree of
attenuation \emph{increases}.  This significantly impacts the behavior of the model, for instance $p=1$ is
precisely a wounded nucleon model, while $-1 \lesssim p \lesssim 0$ mimics features of CGC saturation based models.

The reduced thickness possesses several other key properties.  It is
\begin{itemize*}
  \item continuous and monotonically increasing: \\ if $T_A \leq T_A'$ and $T_B \leq T_B'$, then $T_R \leq T_R'$;
  \item symmetric in the projectile thicknesses: \\
    $T_R(p; T_A, T_B) = T_R(p; T_B, T_A)$, and hence
  \item independent of $p$ when the thicknesses are equal: \\
    $T_R(p; T, T) = T$.
  \item it vanishes when both $T_A$ and $T_B$ vanish: $T_R(p; 0, 0) = 0$.  In fact, for $p
    \leq 0$, $T_R$ vanishes if \emph{either} $T_A$ or $T_B$ do.  On the other hand, positive values of $p$
    introduce small violations of the eikonal entropy production postulate, similar to a traditional wounded
    nucleon model.
\end{itemize*}

Finally, the reduced thickness provides the basis of the model name:
\trento, for Thickness-Reduced Event-by-event Nuclear Topology.

We now detail the construction of the thickness functions $T_{A,B}(x, y)$, which combined with the definition
of the reduced thickness completes the specification of the model.  The procedure is constructed from the
ground up to handle a variety of collision systems; we begin with the simplest case.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics{saturation}
  \caption{

    varied.  The corresponding $T_R$ are shown for $p = 1$, 0, $-1$ (green, blue, and red).
  }
\end{figure}

\subsection{Proton-proton collisions}

Consider a collision of two protons $A$, $B$ with impact parameter $b$ along the $x$-direction.
Denote their nuclear densities by
\begin{equation}
  \rho_{A,B} = \rho_\text{proton}(x \pm b/2, y, z),
\end{equation}
and let us assume that the integral $\int dz \, \rho_\text{proton}$ either has a closed form or may be
evaluated numerically, so that the proton thickness functions can be calculated.

We now randomly decide whether the protons collide according to the probability \cite{dEnterria:2010hd}
\begin{equation}
  P_\text{coll} = 1 - \exp\biggl[ -\sigma_{gg} \int dx \, dy \int dz \, \rho_A \int dz \, \rho_B \biggr],
  \label{eq:pcoll}
\end{equation}
where the integral in the exponential is the overlap integral of the proton thickness functions and
$\sigma_{gg}$ is a cross-section which is set so that the total proton-proton cross-section equals the
experimental inelastic nucleon nucleon cross-section $\sigma_{NN}$.

Assuming the protons collide, each is assigned a \emph{fluctuated} thickness
\begin{equation}
  T_{A,B}(x, y) = \gamma_{A,B} \int dz \, \rho_{A,B}(x, y),
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_{A,B}$ are independent random numbers sampled from a gamma distribution with unit mean,
\begin{equation}
  P(\gamma; k) \propto \gamma^{k-1} e^{-\gamma/k},
\end{equation}
with shape parameter $k > 0$ to be fixed by experiment.  The gamma distribution is chosen for its
flexibility---it is exponential for $k = 1$ and becomes Gaussian for large $k$---and because it is the
continuous analog of the negative binomial distribution, which has historically been used to fit proton-proton
multiplicity fluctuations.

The reduced thickness is then calculated from the projectile thickness functions; this furnishes the initial
transverse entropy profile up to an overall normalization factor, $dS/dy \propto T_R(p; T_A, T_B)$.

\subsection{Larger systems}

Composite collision systems such as proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus are essentially treated as
superpositions of proton-proton collisions.  A set of nucleon positions is chosen for each
projectile $A$, $B$, then the collision probability \eqref{eq:pcoll} is sampled for each pairwise interaction.
Those nucleons that collide with at least one partner are labeled ``participants'' and the rest are discarded.
The fluctuated thickness function for projectile $A$ is then
\begin{equation}
  T_A = \sum_i \gamma_i \int dz \, \rho_\text{proton}(x - x_i, y - y_i, z - z_i),
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_i$ and $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ are the random fluctuation factor and position, respectively, of
participant $i$ in projectile $A$.  $T_B$ is constructed using the same definition over its participants.

\textbf{SOMETHING HERE?}


\begin{figure*}[t]
  \includegraphics{multdist}
  \caption{
    \label{fig:multdist}
    Multiplicity distributions for proton-proton, proton-lead, and lead-lead collisions.  The blue histograms
    are \protect\trento\ results from $10^6$ minimum-bias events for each collision system, all with reduced
    thickness parameter $p = 0$ (geometric mean) and gamma fluctuation parameter $k = 0.8$.  The normalization
    constants indicated in the legends are set so that the model and experimental distributions (points with
    error bars) have the same mean.  Experimental data are from ALICE \needcite.
  }
\end{figure*}


\section{Results}

\trento\ simulations depend on several undetermined parameters---to rigorously constrain these parameters
would require a systematic model-to-data comparison which is beyond the scope of this work.  Therefore, the
following results do not necessarily represent the best-fit of the model to data.

\subsection{Multiplicity distributions}

Charged-particle multiplicity $\nch$ is to an excellent approximation proportional to the total initial
entropy \needcite, and hence proportional to the integrated reduced thickness:
\begin{equation}
  \nch \propto \int dx \, dy \, T_R.
\end{equation}
To compare with experiment, we generate a large ensemble of minimum-bias events, integrate their $T_R$
profiles, and multiply by a normalization constant to rescale the distribution to the experimental mean.

The left panel of FIG.~\ref{fig:multdist} shows the $\nch$ distribution from $10^6$ proton-proton simulations
using reduced thickness parameter $p = 0$ (geometric mean), gamma fluctuation parameter $k = 0.8$, and
Gaussian beam-integrated proton density
\begin{equation}
  \int dz \, \rho_\text{proton} = \frac{1}{2\pi B} \exp\biggr( -\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2B} \biggr)
\end{equation}
with effective area $B = (0.6\;\text{fm})^2$.  Results compare favorably with the experimental distribution
measured by ALICE \needcite.

Proton-lead and lead-lead distributions are presented in the middle and right panels of
FIG.~\ref{fig:multdist}.  We use lead nucleus configurations including nucleon-nucleon correlations from
\cite{Alvioli:2009ab}; model parameters are otherwise identical to proton-proton.

The model is able to reproduce the shape of each distribution using a single set of parameters except for the
overall normalization factor, whose $\sim$20\% variation across collision systems is consistent with
differences in experimental beam energy and kinematic cuts.

\subsection{Eccentricity harmonics}

\begin{figure}[b]
  \includegraphics{eccentricity}
  \caption{
    \label{fig:eccen}
    Upper plot:  Eccentricity harmonics $\varepsilon_2$ (solid lines) and $\varepsilon_3$ (dashed lines) as a
    function of centrality for reduced thickness parameters $p = 1$, 0, $-1$ (green, blue, and red).  Lower
    plot:  Ratio of the rms eccentricities $\eccratio$ against the experimentally allowed region (grey band)
    from \cite{Retinskaya:2013gca}.  Note that the centrality axis has a different range in the ratio plot.
  }
\end{figure}

Eccentricity harmonics $\varepsilon_n$ are calculated for lead-lead collisions using the definition
\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon_n e^{i n\phi} = -\frac{\int dx \, dy\, r^n e^{i n \phi} \, T_R}{\int dx \, dy \, r^n \, T_R}.
\end{equation}
Figure~\ref{fig:eccen} shows ellipticity $\varepsilon_2$ and triangularity $\varepsilon_3$ as a function of
centrality for reduced thickness $p = 1$,~0,~$-1$.  There is a clear trend of increasing eccentricity
(particularly $\varepsilon_2$) with decreasing $p$.  This may be understood by the attenuation property of the
reduced thickness:  as $p$ decreases, asymmetric regions of the collision produce less entropy, which
accentuates the elliptical overlap shape in noncentral collisions and enhances eccentricity.

In addition, we perform the test described in \cite{Retinskaya:2013gca}.  The authors use experimental flow data
and hydrodynamics to construct an experimentally allowed band of the ratio of root-mean-square eccentricities
$\eccratio$ as a function of centrality.  They check a number of common initial condition models and find that
only IP-Glasma consistently falls within the allowed region.  The bottom panel of FIG.~\ref{fig:eccen} shows
that the geometric mean ($p = 0$) yields excellent agreement with experiment.

\subsection{Ultracentral uranium-uranium}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{uranium}
  \caption{
    \label{fig:uranium}
    Ellipticity $\varepsilon_2$ as a function of normalized charged-particle multiplicity
    $\nch/\langle\nch\rangle$ in ultracentral uranium-uranium and gold-gold collisions at RHIC.  The top and
    bottom plots show the top 0.1\% and 1\% (respectively) of collisions selected by number of spectators to
    mimic STAR's experimental ZDC selection \cite{FortheSTAR:2013bza}.  Blue points with error bars are binned
    \protect\trento\ results from $10^6$ events with reduced thickness parameter $p = 0$ (geometric mean) and
    gamma fluctuation parameter $k = 0.8$.  Blue lines are linear fits within
    $0.9~<~\nch/\langle\nch\rangle~<~1.1$.  Grey lines represent the analogous Glauber+NBD slopes calculated
    in \cite{FortheSTAR:2013bza}.
  }
\end{figure}

Uranium nuclei have a deformed prolate spheroid shape, thus a uranium-uranium collision may achieve maximal
overlap via two distinct orientations:  ``tip-tip'', in which the long axes of the spheroids are aligned with
the beam axis and the overlap area is circular; or ``side-side'', where the long axes are perpendicular to the
beam axis and the overlap area is elliptical.

In the two-component Glauber model, tip-tip collisions have the same number wounded nucleons but more binary
collisions than side-side, so tip-tip would have larger multiplicity.  Therefore, the Glauber model predicts a
rapid decrease in elliptic flow $v_2$ as a function of multiplicity in the most central uranium-uranium
collisions.  This structure is known as the ``knee'' \needcite.

The STAR experiment at RHIC recently performed uranium-uranium collisions and found no evidence of a knee
\cite{FortheSTAR:2013bza}.  It has been proposed that fluctuations could wash out the knee \needcite, but a recent
comprehensive flow analysis showed that the knee would still be visible \cite{osu}.

The reduced thickness ansatz \eqref{eq:tr} does not have binary collision scaling and hence produces roughly
constant ellipticity in ultracentral uranium-uranium, as shown in FIG.~\ref{fig:uranium}.  Short of conducting
a full hydrodynamic analysis, these results appear to be more consistent with STAR data than Glauber, and are
similar to IP-Glasma \needcite.


\section{Conclusion}

We introduce \trento, a new unified initial condition model for high-energy nuclear collisions based on
eikonal entropy creation via the ``reduced thickness''.  The model is able to simultaneously fit
proton-proton, proton-lead, and lead-lead multiplicity distributions along with lead-lead eccentricity
harmonics, and provides a possible resolution to the ``knee'' problem in ultracentral uranium-uranium
collisions.  It is flexible by design and able to mimic the behavior of other initial condition models.

This is an intentionally \emph{effective} model.  A first-principles derivation would be ideal, but such
models are usually complex and require significant computation time.  So in practical terms, effective models
are often preferable for empirical modeling.

Future work will couple the initial condition generator to a full hydrodynamical simulation and constrain the
various model parameters.  We plan to publicly release \trento\ in the coming weeks, and the community is
encouraged to use, test, and contribute to the source code.
