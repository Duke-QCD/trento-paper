%\section{Introduction}

%Over the last decade, the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision programs at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider 
%(LHC) have succeeded in producing and exploring a novel, highly excited phase of QCD matter dubbed the strongly interacting Quark-Gluon Plasma (sQGP) 
%\cite{Arsene:2004fa,Adcox:2004mh,Back:2004je,Adams:2005dq,Gyulassy:2004zy,Muller:2006ee,Muller:2012zq}.  

Viscous relativistic fluid dynamics provides a stable, well-tested description of the time-evolution and collectivite behavior in high-energy 
nuclear collisions \cite{PhysRevLett.89.159901,Teaney:2004qa,Chaudhuri:2005ea,Muronga:2004sf}. However, a realistic Monte Carlo (MC) model for the initial 
state of the medium is essential for describing many event-by-event observables. These initial conditions remain one of the most poorly-constrained 
components of modern computational models \cite{Song:2010mg}.

Initial condition models create profiles of energy or entropy at the time of sQGP formation which are then evolved by fluid dynamics. Perhaps the simplest 
prescription is the so-called wounded nucleon model which deposits initial energy or entropy proportional to the local density of participant nucleons \cite{Białłas1976461}. 
The wounded nucleon model was later generalized to include additional contributions from binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, forming the basis of a two-component
model commonly referred to as the Glauber model. Despite its simplicity, the Glauber model has qualitatively fit a large number of experimental measurements \cite{}.

Recently, the PHENIX collaboration demonstrated that a quark participant model can be used to fit the transverse energy distributions in 
proton-proton, deuteron-gold and gold-gold collisions without the use of additional binary collision terms \cite{PhysRevC.89.044905}. Such a description may provide a natural successor to 
current Glauber initial condition models, although it is unclear if wounded quark models yield accurate hydrodynamic flows or remain valid at LHC energies where gluon occupation is expected to dominate.

The current state-of-the-art for initial condition models is the IP-Glasma model \cite{Schenke:2012wb}, which is based on the color-glass condensate (CGC) effective 
field theory \cite{Gelis:2010nm} to create a dynamical description of the pre-fluid stage of the collision.  IP-Glasma has been able to quantitatively describe the 
latest event-by-event data on higher order flow harmonics as well as many other observables \cite{Schenke:2014zha}. It's main draw back is it's computational 
complexity and that it's applicability to smaller collision systems (e.g.~proton-proton) remains uncertain.

In this letter we present \trento, a new initial condition model for high-energy nuclear collisions, designed to model a wide range of systems, including but not limited to proton-proton, proton-lead, gold-gold, 
lead-lead and uranium-uranium collisions. In concert with transport calculations for the time-evolution of ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions, \trento\ provides an effective and computationally cheap method
for simulating and extracting fundamental properties of sQGP matter. 

We now detail the construction of the model which proceeds in a similar fashion to a two-component Glauber model, but with a different ansatz for the deposition of entropy. 

%\section{The Model}

Suppose a pair of projectiles labeled $A$, $B$ collide along beam axis $z$.  Each projectile is represented by
the beam-integrated density of its nuclear matter, typically called a nuclear thickness:
\begin{equation}
  T_{A,B}(x, y) = \int dz \, \rho_{A,B}(x, y, z).
\end{equation}
The construction of the thickness functions will be addressed in the following subsections; first, we
postulate the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The eikonal approximation is valid:  entropy is produced if $T_A$ and $T_B$ eikonally overlap.
  \item There exists a scalar field $f(T_A, T_B)$ which converts projectile thicknesses into entropy
    deposition.
\end{enumerate}
The function $f$ is proportional to the entropy created at mid-rapidity and at the hydrodynamic thermalization
time:
\begin{equation}
  f \propto dS/dy \, |_{\tau = \tau_0}.
\end{equation}
It should provide an \emph{effective} description of early collision dynamics:  it need not arise from a
first-principles calculation, but it must obey basic physical constraints.

With this in mind, we introduce for $f$ the \emph{reduced thickness}
\begin{equation}
  f = T_R(p; T_A, T_B) \equiv \biggl( \frac{T_A^p + T_B^p}{2} \biggr)^{1/p},
  \label{eq:tr}
\end{equation}
so named because it takes two thicknesses $T_A$, $T_B$ and ``reduces'' them to a third thickness, similar to a
reduced mass.  The dimensionless parameter $p$ may take any real value in $(-\infty, \infty)$ and is to be
determined by experiment.  This functional form --- known as the generalized mean --- simplifies to arithmetic,
geometric, and harmonic means for certain values of $p$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  T_R(p; T_A, T_B) =
  \begin{cases}
    \dfrac{T_A + T_B}{2} & p = 1 \text{ (arithmetic)}, \\[2ex]
    \sqrt{T_A T_B} & p = 0 \text{ (geometric)}, \\[2ex]
    \dfrac{2\, T_A T_B}{T_A + T_B} & p = -1 \text{ (harmonic)}. \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
More generally, $p$ quantifies the attenuation of entropy production in asymmetric ($T_A \neq T_B$) regions of
the collision, as demonstrated in FIG.~\ref{fig:saturation}.  As $p$ \emph{decreases}, the degree of
attenuation \emph{increases}.  This significantly impacts the behavior of the model, for instance $p=1$ is
precisely a wounded nucleon model, while $-1 \lesssim p \lesssim 0$ mimics features of CGC saturation based models.

The reduced thickness possesses several other key properties.  It is
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item continuous and monotonically increasing, \\ if $T_A \leq T_A'$ and $T_B \leq T_B'$, then $T_R \leq T_R'$;
  \item symmetric in the projectile thicknesses, \\ $T_R(p; T_A, T_B) = T_R(p; T_B, T_A)$;
  \item independent of $p$ when the thicknesses are equal, \\ $T_R(p; T, T) = T$ and hence
  \item vanishes when $T_A$ and $T_B$ vanish $T_R(p; 0, 0) = 0$. \\ In fact, for $p \leq 0$, $T_R$ vanishes 
     if \emph{either} $T_A$ or $T_B$ do.  On the other hand, positive values of $p$ introduce small violations 
    of the eikonal entropy production postulate, similar to a traditional wounded nucleon model.
\end{enumerate*}

Finally, the reduced thickness provides the basis of the model name:
\trento, for Thickness-Reduced Event-by-event Nuclear Topology.

We now detail the construction of the thickness functions $T_{A,B}(x, y)$, which combined with the definition
of the reduced thickness completes the specification of the model.  The procedure is constructed from the
ground up to handle a variety of collision systems; we begin with the simplest case.

\begin{figure}[t]

    varied.  The corresponding $T_R$ are shown for $p = 1$, 0, $-1$ (green, blue, and red).

    thickness parameter $p = 0$ (geometric mean) and gamma fluctuation parameter $k = 0.8$.  The normalization
    constants indicated in the legends are set so that the model and experimental distributions (points with
    error bars) have the same mean.  Experimental data are from ALICE \needcite.
  }
\end{figure*}

%\subsection{Proton-proton collisions}

Let us consider a collision of two protons $A$, $B$ with impact parameter $b$ along the $x$-direction.
We denote their nuclear densities by
\begin{equation}
  \rho_{A,B} = \rho_\text{proton}(x \pm b/2, y, z),
\end{equation}
and assume that the integral $\int dz \, \rho_\text{proton}$ either has a closed form or may be
evaluated numerically, so that the proton thickness functions can be calculated.

We now randomly sample the collision probability of the protons according to \cite{dEnterria:2010hd},
\begin{equation}
  P_\text{coll} = 1 - \exp\biggl[ -\sigma_{\mathrm{partonic}} \int dx \, dy \int dz \, \rho_A \int dz \, \rho_B \biggr],
  \label{eq:pcoll}
\end{equation}
where the integral in the exponential is the overlap integral of the proton thickness functions and
$\sigma_{\mathrm{partonic}}$ is a parton-parton cross-section which is tuned such that the total proton-proton 
cross-section in our model equals the experimentally measured inelastic nucleon nucleon cross-section $\sigma_{NN}$.

Assuming the protons collide, each is assigned a \emph{fluctuated} thickness
\begin{equation}
  T_{A,B}(x, y) = \gamma_{A,B} \int dz \, \rho_{A,B}(x, y),
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_{A,B}$ are independent random numbers sampled from a gamma distribution with unit mean,
\begin{equation}
  P(\gamma; k) \propto \gamma^{k-1} e^{-\gamma/k},
\end{equation}
with the shape parameter $k > 0$ to be fixed by experiment.  The gamma distribution is chosen for its
flexibility -- it is exponential for $k = 1$ and becomes Gaussian for large $k$ -- and because it is the
continuous analog of the negative binomial distribution, which has historically been used to fit proton-proton
multiplicity fluctuations.

The reduced thickness is then calculated from the projectile thickness functions; this furnishes the initial
transverse entropy profile up to an overall normalization factor, 
\begin{equation}
dS/dy \, |_{\tau = \tau_0} \propto T_R(p; T_A, T_B).
\end{equation}

%\subsection{Larger systems p+A and A+A}

Composite collision systems such as proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus are essentially treated as
superpositions of proton-proton collisions.  A set of nucleon positions is sampled for each
projectile $A$, $B$, utilizing either an uncorrelated Woods-Saxon distribution or correlated nuclear configurations 
when available \cite{Alvioli:2009ab}. Subsequently the collision probability \eqref{eq:pcoll} is sampled for each 
pairwise interaction. Those nucleons that collide with at least one partner are labeled ``participants'' and the 
rest are discarded. The fluctuated thickness function of nucleus $A$ then reads
\begin{equation}
  T_A = \sum_i \gamma_i \int dz \, \rho_\text{proton}(x - x_i, y - y_i, z - z_i),
  \label{nuclear thickness}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_i$ and $(x_i, y_i, z_i)$ are the random fluctuation factor and position, respectively, of
participant $i$ in nucleus $A$. Fluctuated thickness function $T_B$ follows analygously. 

At this point, it's useful to enumerate the parameters of the model and summarize its construction. 
The inputs to the model are the Monte-Carlo nucleon coordinates $\{\vec{x}_1,\vec{x}_2,...,\vec{x}_{A,B}\}$, a randomly sampled 
nucleus-nucleus impact parameter $b$, the nucleon-nucleon cross section $\sigma_{NN}$, the nucleon density profile 
$\rho_{\mathrm{proton}}$, the Gamma fluctuation shape parameter $k$ in the fluctuated nuclear thickness function, the generalized 
mean exponent $p$ in the definition of the \emph{reduced} thickness function, and an overall normalization factor denoted simply as ``norm''.

The output of the model is the transverse entropy density in an interval about mid-rapidity constructed from the reduced thickness function 
$dS/dy \propto T_R(p;T_A,T_B)$ using expression \eqref{eq:tr}. We now proceed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in 
describing a wide range of collision systems.

%\section{Model Applications}

\trento\ simulations are designed with an inherrent freedom in the choice of several parameters such as the nucleon density profile $\rho_\mathrm{proton}$, Gamma fluctuation parameter $k$,
and generalized mean exponent $p$. Rigorously constraining these parameters would require a systematic model-to-data comparison which is beyond the scope of this work.  
Therefore, the following results do not necessarily represent the best-fit of the model to data.

    $\eccratio$ against the experimentally allowed region (grey band) from \cite{Retinskaya:2013gca}.  Note that the centrality 
    axis has a different range in the ratio plot.
  }
\end{figure*}
%\subsection{Multiplicity distributions}

The experimentally observed charged-particle multiplicity $\nch$ is to a very good approximation proportional to the total initial
entropy \needcite, and hence proportional to the integrated reduced thickness in our model:
\begin{equation}
  \nch \propto \int dx \, dy \, T_R.
\end{equation}
To compare with experiment, we generate a large ensemble of minimum-bias events, integrate their $T_R$
profiles, and determine a multiplicative normalization constant in order to rescale the distribution to the experimental mean.

The left panel of FIG.~\ref{fig:multdist} shows the $\nch$ distribution from $10^6$ proton-proton simulations
using reduced thickness parameter $p = 0$ (geometric mean), gamma fluctuation parameter $k = 0.8$, and
Gaussian beam-integrated proton density
\begin{equation}
  \int dz \, \rho_\text{proton} = \frac{1}{2\pi B} \exp\biggr( -\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2B} \biggr)
\end{equation}
with an effective area of $B = (0.6\;\text{fm})^2$.  The results compare favorably with the experimental distribution
measured by ALICE \needcite.

Proton-lead and lead-lead distributions are presented in the middle and right panels of
FIG.~\ref{fig:multdist}. The Model parameters are  identical to proton-proton, except for the overall normalization factor, which depends on the beam energy and kinematic cuts, both of which vary across the data analyzed in this figure.
Overall, the model is able to reproduce the shapes of all three distributions using a single set of parameters, and only allowing for a change in the normalization, whose $\sim$20\% variation across collision systems is consistent with differences in experimental beam energy and kinematic cuts.

%\subsection{Eccentricity harmonics}

Eccentricity harmonics $\varepsilon_n$ can be calculated using the definition
\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon_n e^{i n\phi} = -\frac{\int dx \, dy\, r^n e^{i n \phi} \, T_R}{\int dx \, dy \, r^n \, T_R}.
\end{equation}
Figure~\ref{fig:eccen} shows ellipticity $\varepsilon_2$ and triangularity $\varepsilon_3$ for Pb+Pb collisions as a function of
centrality for reduced thickness $p = 1$,~0,~$-1$.  There is a clear trend of increasing eccentricity
(particularly $\varepsilon_2$) with decreasing $p$.  This may be understood by the attenuation property of the
reduced thickness:  as $p$ decreases, asymmetric regions of the collision produce less entropy, which
accentuates the elliptical overlap shape in non-central collisions and enhances their eccentricity.

In addition, we perform the test described in \cite{Retinskaya:2013gca} and calculate the ratio of root-mean-square eccentricities
$\eccratio$.  In \cite{Retinskaya:2013gca}, the authors have used experimental flow data
and hydrodynamics to construct an experimentally allowed band of the ratio of root-mean-square eccentricities
as a function of centrality.  They compare a number of common initial condition models to that band and find that
currently only the IP-Glasma model consistently falls within the allowed region.  As can be seen in the bottom panel of FIG.~\ref{fig:eccen} our model yields excellent agreement with the allowed band for
the geometric mean ($p = 0$).

%\subsection{Ultracentral U+U collisions}

    mimic STAR's experimental ZDC selection \cite{FortheSTAR:2013bza}.  Blue points with error bars are binned

    in \cite{FortheSTAR:2013bza}.
  }
\end{figure}

Uranium nuclei have a prolate, spheroidal shape which can be exploited to achieve a larger variance in the anisotropy of thermalized QGP matter. 
These deformed nuclear collisions achieve maximal overlap via two distinct orientations: ``tip-tip'' collisions, in which the long axes of the spheroids are 
aligned with the beam axis and the overlap area is circular; or ``side-side'' collisions, where the long axes are perpendicular to the beam axis and the overlap area is elliptical. 

In the two-component Glauber model, tip-tip collisions have the same number of wounded nucleons as side-side collisions while generating more binary collisions and hence more charged particles.
Consequently, Glauber models predict an excess of tip-tip collisions in ultra-central event classes where binary collision scaling dominates. These tip-tip collisions 
are characterized by highly circular overlap regions and thus are expected to produce very little elliptic flow. This predicted drop in the uranium-uranium elliptic flow harmonic is known as the ``knee'' \needcite.

The STAR experiment at RHIC recently performed uranium-uranium collisions and found no evidence that tip-tip collisions produce more charged particle than side-side collisions and no evidence of the 
a knee-like structure in the measured flow harmonics \cite{FortheSTAR:2013bza}.  It has been proposed that fluctuations could wash out the knee \needcite, but a recent
comprehensive flow analysis showed that the knee would still be visible \cite{osu}.

The reduced thickness ansatz in our model \eqref{eq:tr}, however, does not exhibit binary collision scaling and hence predicts similar slopes for ultra-central 
gold-gold and uranium-uranium collisions as shown in FIG.~\ref{fig:uranium}. Short of conducting a full hydrodynamic analysis, our model results therefore appear to be more consistent 
with STAR data than Glauber, and are similar to calculations by the IP-Glasma model \needcite.


\section{Summary}

We introduce \trento, a new unified initial condition model for high-energy nuclear collisions based on
eikonal entropy creation via a ``reduced thickness'' function.  The model is able to simultaneously fit
proton-proton, proton-lead, and lead-lead multiplicity distributions along with lead-lead eccentricity
harmonics, and provides a possible resolution to the ``knee'' problem in ultracentral uranium-uranium
collisions.  

The model is flexible by design and able to mimic the behavior of other initial condition models. Preliminary results
indicate that

%The fundamental premise motivating \trento\ is that variations in the choice of projectile and target nuclei 
%should not constitute disjoint physical models, but should be describable within a single theoretical framework 
%with well defined bounds that 

%This is an intentionally \emph{effective} model.  A first-principles derivation would be ideal, but such
%models are usually complex and require significant computation time.  So in practical terms, effective models
%are often preferable for empirical modeling.

Future work will couple the initial condition generator to a full hydrodynamical simulation and constrain the
various model parameters.  We plan to publicly release \trento\ in the coming weeks, and the community is
encouraged to use, test, and contribute to the source code.
