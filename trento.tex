\begin{abstract}
  We investigate entropy deposition at mid-rapidity in pp, pA and AA systems using a generalized mean of
  projectile and target densities $M_p(T_A,T_B)$ which describes a family of vector norms spanning a continuum
  of projectile/target saturation scenarios.  Results are presented for three well known subcases of the
  generalized mean, the arithmetic, geometric and harmonic forms and compared against charged particle
  production in a wide range of collision systems. When combined with partonic density fluctuations of the
  nucleons within each nucleus, the data is well described by a generalized mean with power $p$ close to zero.
  We encapsulate these results in a new model for relativistic hydrodynamic initial conditions.

\section{Introduction}

Viscous relativistic fluid dynamics provides a stable, well-tested model for the time-evolution and collective
behavior in high-energy nuclear collision.  However, a realistic Monte Carlo (MC) model for the initial state of
the medium is essential for describing many event-by-event observables.   These initial conditions remain one
of the most poorly-constrained components of modern computational models.

Initial condition models create profiles of energy or entropy density at some early time which are then
evolved by fluid dynamics; several prescriptions are commonly used today.  Perhaps the simplest is the
so-called wounded nucleon model, which determines participating nucleons via optical overlap and deposits a
blob of energy for each participant.  The MC-Glauber model generalizes the wounded nucleon description by
additionally depositing entropy proportional to the number of nucleon-nucleon collisions.  Despite its
simplicity, the Glauber model has qualitatively fit a variety of experimental measurements.

Several models are based on the color-glass condensate (CGC) effective field theory.  The MC-KLN model is one
of the simpler implementations.  More recently, the IP-Glasma model applied CGC and classical Yang-Mills
theory to create a dynamical description of the pre-fluid stage of the collision.  IP-Glasma has
quantitatively fit many experimental data.  However, it is theoretically and computationally complex and its
applicability to smaller collision systems (e.g.~proton-proton) is uncertain.

In this letter, we present a new unified initial condition model for high-energy collisions ranging from
proton-proton to nucleus-nucleus.


\section{Model}

The model is built from the ground up to handle a variety of collision systems.  Let us first consider the
simplest case, a proton-proton collision.

Suppose a pair of protons collide along beam axis $z$.  Each proton is represented by its
thickness $T(x, y)$; thickness may be thought of as the beam-integrated density of nuclear matter,
\begin{equation}
  T(x, y) = \int dz \, \rho(x, y, z).
\end{equation}
Label the protons $A$, $B$ with corresponding thicknesses $T_A(x, y)$, $T_B(x, y)$.

We now postulate the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The eikonal approximation is valid:  entropy is produced if $T_A$ and $T_B$ eikonally overlap.
  \item There exists a scalar field $f(T_A, T_B)$ which converts projectile thicknesses into entropy
    deposition.
\end{enumerate}
The function $f$ is interpreted as the entropy created at the hydrodynamic thermalization time.  It should be
provide an \emph{effective} description of early collision dynamics:  it need not arise from a
first-principles calculation, but must obey basic physical restrictions.

With this in mind, we propose for $f$ the family of functions
\begin{equation}
  f = f(p; T_A, T_B) = \biggl( \frac{T_A^p + T_B^p}{2} \biggr)^{1/2},
\end{equation}
where the parameter $p$ is any real number in $(-\infty, \infty)$.  This functional form---known as the
generalized mean---reduces to the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic mean for certain values of $p$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
  f(p; T_A, T_B) =
  \begin{cases}
    \dfrac{T_A + T_B}{2} & p = 1 \text{ (arithmetic)} \\
    \sqrt{T_A T_B} & p = 0 \text{ (geometric)} \\
    \dfrac{1}{1/T_A + 1/T_B} & p = -1 \text{ (harmonic)} \\
  \end{cases}.
\end{equation}


We consider an ultra-relativistic collision between a projectile nucleus with atomic mass number $A$ and
target nucleus with atomic mass number $B$ characterized by collision impact parameter ${\bf b}$ in the
transverse plane $\vec{r}_\perp = \vec{x} \times \vec{y}$. The density of nuclear matter in the rest frame of
each nucleus is described by the relevant un-perturbed multi-body nuclear wavefunction $\Psi_N$, where
$\Psi_N$ is often characterized by the beam-integrated nuclear thickness function,
\begin{equation}
  T(x,y) = \int dz\, \left|\Psi_N(x,y,z) \right|^2.
\end{equation}

Let $T_A$ and $T_B$ denote the transverse density of nucleons determined by the collapse of wavefunctions
$\Psi_A$ and $\Psi_B$ in a given nucleus-nucleus collision. We consider the existence of an eikonal mapping
$f(T_A,T_B)$ that characterizes entropy deposition at mid-rapidity as a function of $T_A$ and $T_B$,
\begin{equation}
  \label{ansatz}
  \frac{dS({\bf r}_\perp)}{d^2r_\perp dy} \biggr \rvert_{y=0} =
  f(T_A({\bf r}_\perp + {\bf b}/2),\,T_B({\bf r}_\perp - {\bf b}/2)).
\end{equation}

It's reasonable to insist that this mapping $f(x_1,x_2)$ respect several key properties, namely that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{$f$ is smooth} \\
    $f'$, $f''$,..., $f^{(k)}$ exist and are continuous
  \item{$f$ is monotonic} \\
    if $x_1 \le x'_1$ and $x_2 \le x'_2$ then $f(x_1,x_2) \le f(x'_1,x'_2)$
  \item{$f$ is symmetric} \\
    $f(x_1,x_2) = f(x_2,x_1)$
  \item{$f$ obeys sensible limits} \\
    $\lim\limits_{x_1,x_2 \to 0} f(x_1,x_2) = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
Motivated by these stipulations, we consider the family of vector p-norms known as the generalized mean as a
suitable ansatz for the mapping $f$,
\begin{equation}
  \label{generalized mean ansatz}
  f(x_1, x_2) \propto M_p(x_1,x_2) = \left( \frac{x_1^p + x_2^p}{2} \right)^{1/p}.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[b]
  \includegraphics{saturation}
  \caption{\label{saturation}Attenuation in the generalized mean $M_p(a, 1)$ for special forms $p=-1, 0, 1$.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure*}[t]
  \includegraphics{multdist}
  \caption{\label{fig:multdist}Minimum bias pp, pPb and PbPb charged particle distributions for power $p=0$,
  fluctuation parameter $k=0.8$ and normalization factor $\kappa'_n$ indicated in the legend.}
\end{figure*}

For $p = \{-\infty,-1,0,1,\infty\}$, the generalized mean becomes minimum, harmonic, geometric, arithmetic and
maximum functions respectively which can be shown to obey the following ordering inequality,
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{if} ~ p<p', ~ \mathrm{then} ~ M_{p}(x_1,x_2) \le M_{p'}(x_1,x_2).
\end{equation}
In this sense, the continuous parameter $p$ characterizes the attenuation of entropy deposited at
mid-rapidity by each nucleon as it pierces the target nucleus. This attenuation is best visualized by fixing
the projectile thickness $T_A$ and varying the target thickness $T_B$ as shown in FIG.~\ref{saturation}.

There is of course one important caveat to the suitability of a generalized mean ansatz. It is easy to see in
FIG.~\ref{fig:multdist} that
\begin{equation}
  \lim\limits_{x_1,x_2 \to 0} f(x_1,x_2) \ne 0 ~\mathrm{for} ~ p>0.
\end{equation}
Blithely applying an arithmetic mean for example to projectile and target densities would deposit entropy in
regions of the fireball where there is nothing to hit.

We thus follow a common prescription and define Eq.~\eqref{ansatz} over \emph{participant} thickness
functions $\mathcal{T}_A$ and $\mathcal{T}_B$ from an underlying Glauber model of independent nucleon-nucleon
collisions with additional source fluctuations $\gamma_i$ in the transverse density $T_p$ contributed by each
participant nucleon,
\begin{equation}
  \label{thickness def}
  \mathcal{T}(x,y) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{part}} \gamma_i\, T_p(x-x_i,y-y_i).
\end{equation}

The weights $\gamma_i$ are sampled from a two parameter Gamma distribution with mean $\mu=1$ and shape
parameter $k$. These weights incorporate event-by-event fluctuations in the density of partons sampled in each
nucleon-nucleon collision. The choice of a Gamma distribution reflects a long history of fitting proton-proton
multiplicity distributions using a Negative Binomial distribution which arises naturally from a Gamma-Poisson
mixture.

For the average transverse parton density $T_p(x,y)$ we use a Gaussian,
\begin{equation}
  T_p(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi B}} \exp\left(-\frac{x^2+y^2}{2 B}\right)
\end{equation}
with fixed nucleon width $B=0.36 ~\mathrm{fm}^2$ although we stress that this is a rather crude description of
the nucleon and consequently restrict our attention to properties of the collision that are insensitive to
details of the nucleonic substructure.

Participant nucleons are determined in the projectile and target nuclei using the probabilistic collision
criteria described in reference \cite{proton-proton}.  The pair-wise collision probability is then sampled
independently for each pair of projectile and target nucleons to determine the participants which contribute
in Eq.~\eqref{thickness def}.

For simplicity, we refer to this generalized mean of participant densities as the \emph{reduced thickness} of
projectile nucleus $A$ and target nucleus $B$,
\begin{equation}
  \label{reduced}
  \mathcal{T}_R(p;x,y) \equiv
  \left( \frac{\mathcal{T}_A({\bf x}+{\bf b}/2,y)^p + \mathcal{T}_B({\bf x}-{\bf b}/2,y)^p}{2} \right)^{1/p}
\end{equation}
noting that the units of $T_R$ are also that of a nuclear thickness function. In terms of the reduced
thickness function, entropy deposition at mid-rapidity is determined according to
\begin{equation}
  \label{entropy deposition}
  \frac{dS({\bf r}_\perp)}{d^2r_\perp dy} \biggr \rvert_{y=0} = \kappa_s(\sqrt{s})\, \mathcal{T}_R(p;{\bf r}_\perp)
\end{equation}
where $\kappa_s(\sqrt{s})$ is an undetermined energy-dependent normalization factor and $\mathcal{T}_R(x,y)$
is the reduced thickness function.

Equivalently, it's been shown that the initial entropy is a close proxy for charged particle multiplicity up
to viscous entropy corrections [?]. We can recast Eq.~\eqref{entropy deposition} in terms of the charged
particle production as,
\begin{equation}
  \label{particle production}
  \frac{dN_{ch}({\bf r}_\perp)}{d^2r_\perp dy} \biggr \rvert_{y=0} \approx
  \kappa_n(\sqrt{s})\, \mathcal{T}_R(p;{\bf r}_\perp)
\end{equation}
which allows us to make a direct comparison with experimentally measured charged particle distributions.

\section{Results}

We now use the aforementioned procedure to generate $10^6$ minimum bias events satisfying $N_{part} > 0$ for
proton-proton, proton-lead and lead-lead nuclei using realistic lead nucleon configurations incorporating
short- and long-range correlations \cite{nucleon-correlations}.

The charged particle distributions are calculated by rescaling Eq.~\eqref{particle production} using a
modified normalization factor $\kappa'_n$ to match the average charged particle multiplicity in the
pseudo-rapidity interval $|\eta| < 1$,
\begin{equation}
  N_{ch}(|\eta|<1) = \kappa'_n(\sqrt{s})\, \mathcal{T}_R(p;{\bf r}_\perp).
\end{equation}

In FIG.~\ref{fig:multdist} we plot the predicted charged particle distributions for pp, pPb and PbPb systems
using a geometric mean $p=0$ with fluctuation parameter $k=0.8$ tuned to fit the pp multiplicity
distribution.

The normalization factor $\kappa'_n$ indicated on the figure is tuned to match the average charged particle
multiplicity in each experiment. The observed $\mathcal{O}(20\%)$ discrepancies in $\kappa'_n$ are consistent
with variations in the collision energy and kinematic cuts.

In FIG.~\ref{fig:eccen} we plot the PbPb ellipticity and triangularity $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$ (top
and middle panels) calculated according to,
\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon_n e^{i n\phi} = -\frac{\int d^2r\, r^n e^{i n \phi} dS/dy(\vec{r})}{\int d^2r\, r^n dS/dy(\vec{r})}.
\end{equation}
along with the eccentricity ratio $\sqrt{\langle \varepsilon_2^2 \rangle}/\sqrt{\langle \varepsilon_3^2
\rangle}^{0.6}$ (bottom panel). The shaded band in the bottom panel indicates the values of this ratio allowed
by LHC flow data and hydrodynamic calculations as determined by the authors in [?].

  \sqrt{\langle \varepsilon_2^2 \rangle}/\sqrt{\langle \varepsilon_3^2 \rangle}^{0.6}$ is shown with the
  experimentally allowed values calculated in ref.\ \cite{constraining-ic}}
\end{figure}

\section{Comparison to wounded nucleon and binary collision mixture}

It's interesting to compare Eq.~\eqref{entropy deposition} against the commonly used wounded nucleon and
binary collision parameterization where the transverse entropy (or energy) density is set proportional to a
linear combination of the local density of participant and pair-wise collisions,
\begin{equation}
  \label{glb ansatz}
  \frac{dS({\bf r}_\perp)}{d^2r_\perp dy} \biggr \rvert_{y=0} \propto
  \frac{1-\alpha}{2}\mbox{WN}({\bf r_\perp}) + \alpha\, \mbox{BC}({\bf r_\perp}).
\end{equation}

In practice, wounded nucleon and binary collision deposition is implemented according to variety of different
prescriptions. We use a two-component model with Gamma fluctuations $\gamma_i$ of the source nucleons given
by,
\begin{equation}
  \label{glb algorithm}
  \frac{dS({\bf r}_\perp)}{d^2r_\perp dy} \biggr \rvert_{y=0} \propto
  \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{part}} \gamma_i \left(\frac{1-\alpha}{2} +
  \alpha \frac{N_{coll,i}}{2} \right ) T_p(\vec{r}-\vec{r}_i)
\end{equation}
where $N_{coll,i}$ denotes the number of collisions suffered by the $i$-th participant. The $N_{coll}$ binary
collision term in Eq.~\eqref{glb ansatz} scales with the product of nuclear thickness functions $N_{coll}
\propto T_A T_B$ and predicts a rapid increase in charged particle production in systems for which the density
of nuclear overlap is large.

In contrast with the two-component model, the proposed generalized mean ansatz exhibits no such quadratic
scaling. Specifically, for an idealized system in which the density of nuclear overlap is perfectly symmetric,
i.e.\ $\mathcal{T}_A = \mathcal{T}_B$, the generalized mean and two-component models behave quite differently:
\begin{equation}
  \label{symmetric scaling}
  \frac{dS}{dy} \propto
  \begin{cases}
    \mathcal{T} + \mathcal{C} \mathcal{T}^2 & \text{two-component,} \\
    \mathcal{T} & \text{generalized mean}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where the coefficient $\mathcal{C}$ scales with the binary collision fraction $\alpha$.

An interesting consequence of this non-linearity becomes manifest in central U-U collisions. The Uranium
nucleus is highly deformed and prolonged along a preferred axis. This geometry allows for two distinct
configurations of Uranium collisions in which the density of nuclear matter is fully overlapping - tip-to-tip
collisions where the Uranium symmetry axis is aligned with the beam axis and side-on-side collisions where
the Uranium symmetry axis is perpendicular to the beam axis.

Binary collision scaling predicts that tip-to-tip collisions generate more charged particles than side-on-side
collisions and hence should be found at slightly higher centralities. It was pointed out that this
multiplicity ordering should imprint itself on the flow harmonics of central UU collisions due to the large
ellipticity expected in side-on-side collisions and small ellipticity expected in body-on-body collisions.
This predicted structure was dubbed the ``knee''.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{uranium}
  \caption{\label{fig:knee}Scaled TRENTO ($p=0$, $k=0.8$, $B=0.36~\mathrm{fm}^2$) and fluctuated Glauber
  ($\alpha=14$, $k=1.2$, $B=0.36~\mathrm{fm}^2$) ellipticities compared to STAR elliptic flow data.}
\end{figure}

In FIG.~\ref{fig:knee} we compare the predictions of the fluctuated two-component Eq.~\eqref{glb algorithm}
and generalized mean prescriptions Eq.~\eqref{entropy deposition} using $10^6$ minimum bias events
in the impact parameter range $0<b<3.5 ~\mathrm{fm}$ with a $15\%$ cut to avoid contamination from events
$b>3.5 ~\mathrm{fm}$.

The fluctuated two component model shows clear evidence of a knee structure in the $0-0.5\%$ centrality bin
which is inconsistent with the STAR data. These findings agree with those previously reported in a
comprehensive flow analysis by A.\ Goldschmidt, Zhi Qiu and U.\ Heinz, in preparation and private communication.
The authors in [?] found that a hot-spot model with sharply peaked entropy density fluctuations described by
concentrated semi-hard cross-section $\sigma \approx 2 ~\mathrm{mb}$ is sufficient to wash out the structure
of the knee in UU collisions, but it remains to be seen if such sharply peaked hot-spots fit into a coherent
description of charged particle production in small systems.

In contrast to the two-component model, the generalized mean correctly reproduces the shape of the
ultra-central elliptic flow measured by STAR. This suggests that non-linearities in the mapping discussed in
Eq.~\eqref{symmetric scaling} are small and it supports attenuation as the mechanism which describes the
centrality dependence of charged particle production in AA collisions.


\section{Summary}

Initial conditions currently comprise the largest source of uncertainty in hydrodynamic simulations of the QGP
fireball [refs]. Ideally, one seeks a first principles calculation of the initial state (i.e.\ see refs), but
these derivations are often irrelevant to the problem of interest making effective models an attractive
alternative.

We propose the family of vector p-norms known as the generalized mean as an effective model for entropy
production in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions and demonstrate the model's ability to
replicate pp, pPb and PbPb multiplicity distributions. In FIG.~\ref{fig:eccen} we show that the predicted
ellipticity of the produced fireball is highly sensitive to the power of the p-norm while the fluctuation
driven triangularity is less sensitive. The optimal ratio of these harmonics which was extracted from flow
data in reference [?] prefers a value of p close to 0 corresponding to the geometric mean. We note that
geometric mean scaling of the initial entropy was also reported by an AdS-CFT calculation in reference [?].

We also compare the generalized mean ansatz against a fluctuated two-component model in Uranium-Uranium
collisions where one expects the eccentricity harmonics to behave quite differently. The generalized mean
correctly predicts the shape of the elliptic flow in ultra-central UU collisions while the two-component model
exhibits a well known knee structure which is inconsistent with the STAR data.
