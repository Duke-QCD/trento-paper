# Figures

The data files for the figures are too large to be tracked in git (total compressed size ~310 MiB).
Instead, an archive containing the data is publicly available at http://phy.duke.edu/~jeb65/trento-fig-data.tar.gz.
Run the included script `./download-data` to download the archive, verify its integrity, and extract it.

After acquiring the data, run `./make-plots`.
